# Problem Solving

These are a few simple scripts I've written to aid in solving selected problems from TCD Mathsoc's weekly problem solving sessions. They will tend to be sloppily written, and in many cases might not even run. I've shoved them up here to share with other solvers and to keep track of my 'solutions'.
